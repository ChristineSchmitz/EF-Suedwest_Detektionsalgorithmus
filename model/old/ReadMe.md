Description of the different Weights

DLR-Detection-v1.pt: First version of the detection trained on trees and buds, not traind with the augmented data 

DLR-Detection-v2.pt: Second version of the detection trained on trees, buds and flower clusters, not traind with the augmented data, previous version were used as initial weights

DLR-Detection-v3.pt: Third version of the detection trained on trees, buds, flower clusters and apples, trained with augmented data, previous version were used as initial weights, heavliy trained on non augmented dataset and only slightly trained on augmented dataset

DLR-Detection-v3_old.pt: Third version of the detection trained on trees, buds, flower clusters and apples, not trained with augmented data, previous version were used as initial weights, heavliy trained on non augmented dataset

DLR-Detection-v3_aug.pt: Third version of the detection trained on trees, buds, flower clusters and apples, trained with augmented data, yolov5 default weights were used as initial weights, only trained on augmented dataset
